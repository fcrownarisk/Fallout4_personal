Fallout4 GAME series developed by Bethesda Studio,
in account of the limit of my computer Graphic display rate,so that I cannot run Fallout 4 game more than 60 fps,
i decided to make a Fallout Game in sum under TCP/IP protocol,
with a large map support,it should be easy to understand and simple to config just like Fallout News Vegas and Fallout 3
